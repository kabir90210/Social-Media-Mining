phxees,"I recently watched a talk about how this happens at the MS Build conference.

Basically the model goes down a path while it is writing and it can’t backtrack.  It says “oh sure I can help you with that …”  then it looks for the information to make the first statement be true, and it can’t currently backtrack when it can’t find anything.  So it’ll make up something.  This is an over simplification, and just part of what I recall, but iI found it interesting.  

It seems that it’s random because sometimes it will take a path, based on the prompt and other factors that leads it to the correct answer that what your asking isn’t possible.

Seems like the problem is mostly well understood, so they may have a solution in place within a year.

Edit:  [link](https://youtu.be/bZQun8Y4L2A). The talk explains much of ChatGPT. The portion where he discusses hallucinations is somewhere between the middle and end.

3.	They act like an idiot when the possibility of sanctions comes up

It's not that the bot couldn't learn hangman, or poetry, or puns, or whatever else it if we gave it the chance: but it's fundamentally incapable of seeing individual letters because we instead group letters together into ""tokens"" before sending them through GPT. This is to save on resources, since the big innovation behind GPT is its attention to prior context. We'd sacrifice a lot of word-level context if we swapped from using tokens (common clumps of letters) to individual characters.

The real danger in AI like this is that most people don't truly understand it.  Because the responses appear to be like a human response to a question, they assume it's some kind of intelligence that's thinking through this - it's absolutely not.

BriarKnave,"There's a YouTube channel I follow and enjoy that discusses mostly ancient history, old storytelling tropes, and mythology. Sometimes they do deep dives into old stories, and she hits a wall where there's popular thought but no sources sometimes. And sometimes that's because the sources are post-christian invasion and the original religion wasn't around anymore, which, that sucks but at least it's understandable. Christian missionaries LOVE rewriting myths to make people believe in Jesus, it's their whole thing, it's a piece of the historical landscape. 

But there's one where she's trying to explain the origins of Persephone's kidnapping and had to take a whole section of the video just to explain that the ""matriarchal"" interpretation isn't actually based on contemporary sources. It was made up by a woman writing a children's anthology in the 70s, and the ""source"" she cited for her version was ""I took a guess at what I think this could be based on my beliefs as a modern woman."" Which, modern interpretations of old stories are cool, BUT THAT'S NOT A SOURCE!! 

Imagine something like that, but there's no tracing where the misinformation came from because the book doesn't exist. There's no article that explains why someone made it up. There's no authors blurb admitting it's interpretation. Just circles upon circles of trying to figure out if something is true all because someone who should know better trusted a chat bot like 15 years before.

I asked it to write Python using a specific (uncommon) library. The primary purpose behind my experimenting was to see how it dealt with questions it didn't have enough information to answer correctly.

If it needed a function the library didn't have, it made it up. If the library had a function to do something specific, it would sometimes just totally ignore the intended purpose and make up a new (completely wrong) purpose for the function.

When I corrected it (or asked it to double-check), it often doubled-down and cited nonexistent documentation to back up its non-working code.

ThePryde,"This is like trying to hammer a nail in with a screwdriver and being surprised when it doesn't work. 

The problem with chatgpt is that most people don't really understand what it is. Most people see the replies it gives and think it's a general AI or even worse an expert system, but it's not. It's a large language model, it's only purpose is to generate text that seems like it would be a reasonable response to the prompt. It doesn't know ""facts"" or have a world model, it's just a fancy auto complete. It also has some significant limitations. The free version only has about 1500 words of context memory, anything before that is forgotten. This is a big limitation because without that context its replies to broad prompts end up being generic and most likely incorrect. 

To really use chatgpt effectively you need to keep that in mind when writing prompts and managing the context. To get the best results you prompts should be clear, concise, and specific about the type of response you want to get back. Providing it with examples helps a ton. And make sure any relevant factual information is within the context window, never assume it knows any facts.

bobartig,"So the thing that GPT really excels at is semantic understanding, that is to say, treating an abstract concept correctly in context. This is because the meaning of an abstract concept is more or less the aggregate of its statistical relationship to all other words it appears near, in all contexts where that word appears in language. I'm not certain people would have expected semantic linguistics to be solvable in this way, if it were not for LLM development and models like GPT, but GPT's performance at this point makes that conclusion hard to avoid.

ChatGPT has ""solved"" that problem for millions of abstract concepts. However, it doesn't ""know"" factual things at all. You can get much better results if you ground the model to a corpus of facts, and instruct the model to treat them as true. This is why a lot of the commercial applications of GPT right now are:

1. Take existing database/search engine of reliable facts.
2. Query from existing, reliable database to provide grounding material.
3. Provide grounding material to GPT, ask GPT a question about that material.
4. Include ability to ""cite"" back to the grounding material.

Once you slap this framework together, GPT becomes fairly useful for understanding those facts. But without that grounding, it is not very useful for fact-based inquiry.",2023-05-28 17:39:18,5

ziptofaf,"I mean, that's not a ""problem"".

It's how it was built and it performs **exactly** according to specification.

It's a statistical model that given a sequence of words generates next sequence of words that are most likely to occur.

It's not that it ""makes shit up"". Ultimately ChatGPT most likely runs at around 400GB and some models you can run at home fit in like 8-20GB. This is not nearly enough storage for ""literally anything written on this planet"". Instead it's an **approximation**. It doesn't directly store any specific legal case, article, application, manual and so on.

In some cases it does better as there are stronger connections between words or they are common enough that it can establish higher level rules surrounding them. In some - not so much. It may be able to generate something that **resembles** a legal case as they have a fairly specific wording and unified structure and in some cases it may even get it right but it's really down to statistical data. Asking it for legal advice in general can give you ton of bullshit since amount of incorrect information flying on the internet that it consumed as an input vastly outpaces legal texts it could possibly access.",2023-05-28 14:56:46,37

tickettoride98,"> As a programmer, seeing all the people say my profession is dead because they can get chatgpt to write code is comical.

It's also comical because folks tend to give it really common tasks and then act amazed it did them. Good chance ChatGPT was even trained on that task in its immense training dataset. Humans are *really* bad at randomness, and you can even see patterns in thought processes across different people: [when asked for a random number between 1-10, seven is massively overrepresented](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/acow6y/asking_over_8500_students_to_pick_a_random_number/). If you could similarly quantify the tasks that people ask ChatGPT to code when they first encounter it, I'd guess they heavily collapse into a handful of categories with some minor differences with the specifics.

Any time I've taken effort to give it a more novel problem, it falls flat on its face. I tried giving it a real-world problem I had just coded up the other day, (roughly speaking) extract some formatted information from Markdown files and transform it, and it was a mess. Tried to use a CLI-only package as a library with an API, etc. After going around 5 times or so pointing out where it was wrong and trying to get it to correct itself, I gave up.",2023-05-28 20:09:51,18

The base GPT model isn't really taking feedback in the way you're thinking. It's ""trained"" by giving it the internet and other resources, one sentence at a time. 

So if we wanted to train it on this comment, we'd start with the word ""Not"" and expect ""quite"" from it. The bot will give us a list of words which it believes are *most probable* to appear next, and we want ""quite"" to be high on that list. 

Depending on how confident the bot is that ""quite"" comes next: we mathematically adjust how the bot thinks so it's more likely to give us the correct prediction for this situation in the future. 

Eventually it gets good at this, then they stop training it and give it us users to play with, to ""predict"" the endings to sentences that *we've* created which have likely never appeared in its training. 

*Chat*GPT is ""fine tuned""—trained especially hard on *top* of its base training—on chat contexts. That's why it feels like a conversation: the bot is still making predictions, but is trained so hard on chat agents that most of its predictions rank the typical responses of a chat agent really highly.

The follow-up prompts are what seem to be tripping people up the most. They think it's doing introspection, that it comes across contrite and apologetic, that it's ""reconsidering"" its answers or something, but ***no***.

The default web-based UI simulates memory by appending your prompt to an array and sending the full array to the API every time you write a new prompt/message. The sum of the lengths of the messages in the array has a cap, based on the number of “tokens” (1 token is roughly equal to 0.75 word). So if your conversation is too long (not based on the number of messages, but the total number of words/tokens in all your prompts and all its answers) it will simply cut off from the beginning of the conversation. To you it seems like it has forgotten the language, but in reality it is possible that this information is simply not part of the request triggering the “wrong” answer.

JamesKW1,I can't tell if you read the comment and this is a joke or if you're being genuine.,2023-05-28 16:20:07,3
Xarthys,"People certainly were more involved with reading and writing in the past, simply because there really weren't many options to convey complex information any other way compared to current possibilities. With TV and radio also being somewhat limited, because not everyone had access.

Today, the information content isn't necessarily smaller, but it is delivered in a much more compact way; emoticons for example, even memes or pop-culture references. Take a look at entire comment sections on social media, most of the time it's very limited exchange but everyone knows what people are talking about.

Nothing about this has anything to do with happiness (I'm confident I did not imply that), nor intelligence (as other replies seem to assume). It's about the difference in how writing skills mattered more, specifically in a professional environment.

The quip at tl;dr isn't so much about its benefit or history, but more about the expectation these days to provide tl;dr because people don't want to read long texts and tend to get annoyed (and express that) if the individial is not catering towards their personal needs (which there is no obligation to do so as far as I'm concerned).

My point simply is that if you have to read/write a lot, you are exercising a lot more, as you explore different ways to express thoughts in different context. I think ""being fluent"" is a good way to describe this, as the person simply knows how to express themselves properly without giving it much thought. The skill has become such an important part of their job (or personal life), that they do have an easy time reading/writing in general. The ability to draft more complex texts is just a byproduct of that process.

But if you simply avoid reading/writing longer texts, you are getting used to a certain format, while no longer refining skills involved to craft more elaborate texts. It's not a bad thing per se, it's just an observation. 

As an example, if your job requires you to sometimes write in corporate speak, you may stay on top of things. But let's say you haven't written in that style for over two decades for whatever reasons, it's going to be more difficult. Ofc you are going to be impressed by ChatGPT who can do it for you within a short amount of time. 

Something like that wouldn't even have happened in the past because there was no ChatGPT and you had to literally apply yourself in order to get back on track with the corporate speak, because unless you wanted to get fired, you better improved those skills asap.",2023-05-28 19:02:00,3
Xarthys,"It's certainly not new, it's just new-ish within this specific context of using much more sophisticated tools to basically replace entire steps along the process.

If you compare this to 2000 years ago, if someone was unwilling to read something but still write about the topic at large, they either had to do some minimalistic research or simply invent stuff based on some very rudimentary understanding of the topic at hand.

Today, I can feed ChatGPT with keywords I don't understand and have it generate something that sounds solid. It's a lot less effort for the individual.

In both cases, the quality and/or lack of sources is equally problematic, the modern approach is just much more convenient.

That said, the problem isn't trying to avoid dedicating more time towards writing yourself vs. outsourcing it to some software tool, it's that by doing so, the overall skillset will succumb to ""atrophy"" over time, as there is less incentive to use your brain doing this kind of task. 

If society develops in a way where writing about complex topics is no longer required, then I guess it does not matter. But if writing complex texts is still relevant in various jobs, then it's not such a great development for the time being.

This doesn't mean people are going to be less intelligent or less skilled, it just means it will require extra effort to get back on track when required. 
_____
We humans maintain a level of skill due to repetition. The more we do something the better we get at it (usually). Constant use of a skill set and/or continous involvement with a topic keeps us fresh while also exposing us to different ideas and concepts along the way. 

When we retreat from any domain, for whatever reasons, we no longer have that exposure. It may still be relatively easy to re-introduce ourselves and pick up where we left, but sometimes it can be much more of a struggle.

Writing specifically is a skill that requires a lot practice. You can have an entire database of synonyms and impressive phrases at your disposal to express specific things, but unless you put in the time to craft yourself, it's difficult to get a feeling for the language and use it accordingly.

So I'm not entirely sure if Socrates was more upset about taking the easy route, or more concerned about how that might impact people's abilities and talents relevant during his lifetime. 

The way I see it, technology isn't the issue, it's how we use these tools and how that impacts the world around us. 

If future society is going to communicate complex topics only through A.I. generated texts, sure, I guess that's how things will be from then on. But it does make me wonder how much of that human creativity might get lost that is part of that process when writing. There is just something about having thoughts manifesting inside your brain and putting them in writing; it would be sad if that got lost, simply because A.I. would replace that process entirely.",2023-05-28 21:15:53,3

That is a bold claim, not knowing what a living organism would do if it did not have any way to interpret its environment. Not to mention that we don't know what consciousness is and how it emerges.

For example, a being that has no way of collecting any data at all, would it still experience existence? Would it qualify as a conscious being even though it itself can't interact with anything, as it can't make any choices based on input, but only random interactions when it e.g. bumps into something without even realizing what is happening?

And when it just sits there, consuming nutrients, but otherwise unable to perceive anything, not being aware of what it even does, not being able to (re)act, just sitting there, is it still alive? Or is it then just an organic machine processing molecules for no real reason? Is it simply a biochemical reactor?

It would probably be programmed to wait until it hadn't gotten input for x amoit of time before providing it's answer, or asking if there's anything else it could do.

GullibleDetective,"Up until you drill into the context and what it's really writing and expecting unless you're extremely particular and almost an expert on how to input information to it.

 The base of my context here is when LOTR experts got it to try and finish I mean lord of the rings in a short story format. It did match Tolkien's prose for the most part but it gets repetitive and will be very nonspecific on how certain actions occur unless you yourself are extremely particular on the prompts.

Plus we all know it'll make up and reference things that don't exist much like the latest news article here where it was calling out legal precedent that doesn't exist",2023-05-28 17:46:05,10

QuitCallingNewsrooms,I hope so! Their filings are already pretty amazing and I feel like ChatGPT could get them into some truly uncharted territory that will make actual attorneys piss themselves laughing,2023-05-28 15:25:22,11
bHarv44,I think ChatGPT is actually more intelligent than some of the really dumb people I know… and that’s under the interpretation that ChatGPT is not actually intelligent at all.,2023-05-28 21:40:27,6
The_MAZZTer,"Pop culture sees AI as actual sapience. I think largely thanks to Hollywood. We don't have anything like that. The closest thing we have is machine learning which is kinda sorta learning but in a very limited scope, and it can't go beyond the parameters we humans place on it.

Similarly I think Tesla's ""Autopilot"" is a bad name. Hollywood ""Autopilot"" is just Hollywood AI flying/driving for you, no human intervention required. We don't have anything like that. Real autopilot on planes is, at its core concept, relatively simple thanks largely in part to that fact that the sky tends to be mostly empty. Roads are more complex in that regard. Even if Tesla Autopilot meets the criteria for a real autopilot that requires human intervention, the real danger is people who are thinking of Hollywood autopilot, and I feel Tesla should have anticipated this.",2023-05-28 16:57:50,15

bakedSnarf,"That's not entirely true. We exist and live with those same (biological) mechanisms pulling the strings. We operate on input and stimulation from external and internal stimuli. 

In other words, yes, that is how living things work. Just depends on how you look at it.",2023-05-28 14:12:58,14
Fredselfish,"I use an AI tool to help edit my books. Even that's not perfect, and I will have to rewrite its responses.
