‚ÄúBro, listen up 'cause I'm about to unleash the ultimate bro-fusion knowledge bomb on you! Table salt, my dude, is like a solid high-five between sodium and chlorine, the heavyweight champs of the elemental world. Sodium brings the sizzle, like a firework show in your mouth, while chlorine keeps it cool, like a pool party on a scorching summer day. They join forces in a freakin' rock-solid 1:1 ratio, bro, like two alpha bros in perfect harmony. That's how they create sodium chloride, a.k.a table salt, the undefeated champion of flavor town. So when you're spicing up your grub, remember, it's the bromance of sodium and chlorine that's giving your taste buds a front-row ticket to Flavortown, bro!

1. Get in position, bro: Time to strike your pose on the exam table, bro. Lie on your side with your knees pulled up towards your chest. You're about to show off your flexibility skills!
2. Glove up, smooth operator: The doc slips on a glove like a pro and generously applies lube to their finger. Gotta keep it slick and smooth, bro!
3. It's go time, bro: Brace yourself for the big moment. The doc gently inserts their slick finger into your rectum. It might feel a bit strange, but don't worry‚Äîit's all part of the process!
4. Prostate power: The doc skillfully feels around your rectum to locate the prostate gland, just hanging out in front of it. They'll check for any funky business, like bumps or changes in size and texture. They're like detectives on a mission, bro!
5. Wrap it up, bro: Once the doc has gathered all the intel they need, they'll remove their finger and give you the green light. You've conquered the DRE like a champ!
Remember, my bro, it's important to have a solid relationship with your healthcare provider. They'll guide you on when and how often you should have a digital rectal exam based on your age, risk factors, and overall health.

It's not that the bot couldn't learn hangman, or poetry, or puns, or whatever else it if we gave it the chance: but it's fundamentally incapable of seeing individual letters because we instead group letters together into ""tokens"" before sending them through GPT. This is to save on resources, since the big innovation behind GPT is its attention to prior context. We'd sacrifice a lot of word-level context if we swapped from using tokens (common clumps of letters) to individual characters.

Because of the way the model is trained they usually come out as interpretable sentences, but there's no fact checking, consciousness, reasoning or anything like that going on.
The real danger in AI like this is that most people don't truly understand it.  Because the responses appear to be like a human response to a question, they assume it's some kind of intelligence that's thinking through this - it's absolutely not.
It'll get basic facts wrong and it'll make up facts that seems plausible amongst ones that actually match reality.

Sometimes they do deep dives into old stories, and she hits a wall where there's popular thought but no sources sometimes. And sometimes that's because the sources are post-christian invasion and the original religion wasn't around anymore, which, that sucks but at least it's understandable. Christian missionaries LOVE rewriting myths to make people believe in Jesus, it's their whole thing, it's a piece of the historical landscape. 
But there's one where she's trying to explain the origins of Persephone's kidnapping and had to take a whole section of the video just to explain that the ""matriarchal"" interpretation isn't actually based on contemporary sources. It was made up by a woman writing a children's anthology in the 70s, and the ""source"" she cited for her version was ""I took a guess at what I think this could be based on my beliefs as a modern woman."" Which, modern interpretations of old stories are cool, BUT THAT'S NOT A SOURCE!! 
Imagine something like that, but there's no tracing where the misinformation came from because the book doesn't exist. There's no article that explains why someone made it up.

The problem with chatgpt is that most people don't really understand what it is. Most people see the replies it gives and think it's a general AI or even worse an expert system, but it's not. It's a large language model, it's only purpose is to generate text that seems like it would be a reasonable response to the prompt. It doesn't know ""facts"" or have a world model, it's just a fancy auto complete. It also has some significant limitations. The free version only has about 1500 words of context memory, anything before that is forgotten. This is a big limitation because without that context its replies to broad prompts end up being generic and most likely incorrect. 
To really use chatgpt effectively you need to keep that in mind when writing prompts and managing the context. To get the best results you prompts should be clear, concise, and specific about the type of response you want to get back. Providing it with examples helps a ton. And make sure any relevant factual information is within the context window, never assume it knows any facts.

This is because the meaning of an abstract concept is more or less the aggregate of its statistical relationship to all other words it appears near, in all contexts where that word appears in language. I'm not certain people would have expected semantic linguistics to be solvable in this way, if it were not for LLM development and models like GPT, but GPT's performance at this point makes that conclusion hard to avoid.
ChatGPT has ""solved"" that problem for millions of abstract concepts. However, it doesn't ""know"" factual things at all. You can get much better results if you ground the model to a corpus of facts, and instruct the model to treat them as true. This is why a lot of the commercial applications of GPT right now are:
1. Take existing database/search engine of reliable facts.
2. Query from existing, reliable database to provide grounding material.
3. Provide grounding material to GPT, ask GPT a question about that material.
4. Include ability to ""cite"" back to the grounding material.
Once you slap this framework together, GPT becomes fairly useful for understanding those facts. But without that grounding, it is not very useful for fact-based inquiry.",5/28/23 17:39,5,

It's how it was built and it performs **exactly** according to specification.
It's a statistical model that given a sequence of words generates next sequence of words that are most likely to occur.

This is not nearly enough storage for ""literally anything written on this planet"". Instead it's an **approximation**. It doesn't directly store any specific legal case, article, application, manual and so on.
In some cases it does better as there are stronger connections between words or they are common enough that it can establish higher level rules surrounding them. In some - not so much. It may be able to generate something that **resembles** a legal case as they have a fairly specific wording and unified structure and in some cases it may even get it right but it's really down to statistical data.

The base GPT model isn't really taking feedback in the way you're thinking. It's ""trained"" by giving it the internet and other resources, one sentence at a time. 
So if we wanted to train it on this comment, we'd start with the word ""Not"" and expect ""quite"" from it. The bot will give us a list of words which it believes are *most probable* to appear next, and we want ""quite"" to be high on that list. 
Depending on how confident the bot is that ""quite"" comes next: we mathematically adjust how the bot thinks so it's more likely to give us the correct prediction for this situation in the future. 
Eventually it gets good at this, then they stop training it and give it us users to play with, to ""predict"" the endings to sentences that *we've* created which have likely never appeared in its training. 
*Chat*GPT is ""fine tuned""‚Äîtrained especially hard on *top* of its base training‚Äîon chat contexts. That's why it feels like a conversation: the bot is still making predictions, but is trained so hard on chat agents that most of its predictions rank the typical responses of a chat agent really highly.

The follow-up prompts are what seem to be tripping people up the most. They think it's doing introspection, that it comes across contrite and apologetic, that it's ""reconsidering"" its answers or something, but ***no***.

So if your conversation is too long (not based on the number of messages, but the total number of words/tokens in all your prompts and all its answers) it will simply cut off from the beginning of the conversation. To you it seems like it has forgotten the language, but in reality it is possible that this information is simply not part of the request triggering the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù answer.

The AI‚Äôs ability to produce lengthy and thoughtful text stands out in contrast to the perceived limitations of human expression.",5/28/23 16:42,10,
JamesKW1,I can't tell if you read the comment and this is a joke or if you're being genuine.,5/28/23 16:20,3,
Xarthys,"People certainly were more involved with reading and writing in the past, simply because there really weren't many options to convey complex information any other way compared to current possibilities. With TV and radio also being somewhat limited, because not everyone had access.
Today, the information content isn't necessarily smaller, but it is delivered in a much more compact way; emoticons for example, even memes or pop-culture references. Take a look at entire comment sections on social media, most of the time it's very limited exchange but everyone knows what people are talking about.
Nothing about this has anything to do with happiness (I'm confident I did not imply that), nor intelligence (as other replies seem to assume). It's about the difference in how writing skills mattered more, specifically in a professional environment.
The quip at tl;dr isn't so much about its benefit or history, but more about the expectation these days to provide tl;dr because people don't want to read long texts and tend to get annoyed (and express that) if the individial is not catering towards their personal needs (which there is no obligation to do so as far as I'm concerned).
My point simply is that if you have to read/write a lot, you are exercising a lot more, as you explore different ways to express thoughts in different context. I think ""being fluent"" is a good way to describe this, as the person simply knows how to express themselves properly without giving it much thought. The skill has become such an important part of their job (or personal life), that they do have an easy time reading/writing in general. The ability to draft more complex texts is just a byproduct of that process.
But if you simply avoid reading/writing longer texts, you are getting used to a certain format, while no longer refining skills involved to craft more elaborate texts. It's not a bad thing per se, it's just an observation. 
As an example, if your job requires you to sometimes write in corporate speak, you may stay on top of things. But let's say you haven't written in that style for over two decades for whatever reasons, it's going to be more difficult. Ofc you are going to be impressed by ChatGPT who can do it for you within a short amount of time. 
Something like that wouldn't even have happened in the past because there was no ChatGPT and you had to literally apply yourself in order to get back on track with the corporate speak, because unless you wanted to get fired, you better improved those skills asap.",5/28/23 19:02,3,
Xarthys,"It's certainly not new, it's just new-ish within this specific context of using much more sophisticated tools to basically replace entire steps along the process.
If you compare this to 2000 years ago, if someone was unwilling to read something but still write about the topic at large, they either had to do some minimalistic research or simply invent stuff based on some very rudimentary understanding of the topic at hand.
Today, I can feed ChatGPT with keywords I don't understand and have it generate something that sounds solid. It's a lot less effort for the individual.
In both cases, the quality and/or lack of sources is equally problematic, the modern approach is just much more convenient.
That said, the problem isn't trying to avoid dedicating more time towards writing yourself vs. outsourcing it to some software tool, it's that by doing so, the overall skillset will succumb to ""atrophy"" over time, as there is less incentive to use your brain doing this kind of task. 
If society develops in a way where writing about complex topics is no longer required, then I guess it does not matter. But if writing complex texts is still relevant in various jobs, then it's not such a great development for the time being.
This doesn't mean people are going to be less intelligent or less skilled, it just means it will require extra effort to get back on track when required. 
_____
We humans maintain a level of skill due to repetition. The more we do something the better we get at it (usually). Constant use of a skill set and/or continous involvement with a topic keeps us fresh while also exposing us to different ideas and concepts along the way. 
When we retreat from any domain, for whatever reasons, we no longer have that exposure. It may still be relatively easy to re-introduce ourselves and pick up where we left, but sometimes it can be much more of a struggle.
Writing specifically is a skill that requires a lot practice. You can have an entire database of synonyms and impressive phrases at your disposal to express specific things, but unless you put in the time to craft yourself, it's difficult to get a feeling for the language and use it accordingly.
So I'm not entirely sure if Socrates was more upset about taking the easy route, or more concerned about how that might impact people's abilities and talents relevant during his lifetime. 
The way I see it, technology isn't the issue, it's how we use these tools and how that impacts the world around us. 
If future society is going to communicate complex topics only through A.I. generated texts, sure, I guess that's how things will be from then on. But it does make me wonder how much of that human creativity might get lost that is part of that process when writing. There is just something about having thoughts manifesting inside your brain and putting them in writing; it would be sad if that got lost, simply because A.I. would replace that process entirely.",5/28/23 21:15,3,

It's a while yet from replacing anyone. 

Some specific applications though are really cool. There's a famous news reporter here in Ireland who revealed last year he has MND. He has since lost the ability to speak. But an ML team provided hours and hours of recordings of his voice (from years of broadcasts) to an ML algorithm and now he has a device that speaks for him; in his own voice. 

Now that's fucking cool. This is the kind of thing we should be focussing this revolution on; really laborious intricate work that would take a team of humans years to accomplish. Not on replacing people in customer service or cheaping out on creative artists.",5/28/23 20:13,3,

That is a bold claim, not knowing what a living organism would do if it did not have any way to interpret its environment. Not to mention that we don't know what consciousness is and how it emerges.

For example, a being that has no way of collecting any data at all, would it still experience existence? Would it qualify as a conscious being even though it itself can't interact with anything, as it can't make any choices based on input, but only random interactions when it e.g. bumps into something without even realizing what is happening?

And when it just sits there, consuming nutrients, but otherwise unable to perceive anything, not being aware of what it even does, not being able to (re)act, just sitting there, is it still alive? Or is it then just an organic machine processing molecules for no real reason? Is it simply a biochemical reactor?

I'm sure you could hook it up to a live feed rather than passing in fully parsed and tokenized strings on demand.

It could be constantly refreshing what it ""sees"" in the input box, tokenizing what's there, processing it, and coming up with a response, but waiting until the code is confident that it's outputting a useful response, and not just cutting off the asker early. It would probably be programmed to wait until it hadn't gotten input for x amoit of time before providing it's answer, or asking if there's anything else it could do.
