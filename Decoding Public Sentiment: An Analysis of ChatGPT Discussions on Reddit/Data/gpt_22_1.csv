Stay in school.  Become a software developer.  Millions of Uber drivers are not out of a job despite that warning years ago.  ""Soon"", ""Someday"", ""In another 5 years"", ""In 10 years"".  Been hearing these for over 20 years.  Artificial ""Intelligence"" technologies are fantastic at fooling human beings that actually have intelligence. Did anyone fall for seeing the face on Mars?   That didn't even take AI.  We're wired to over-believe.

Think about what engineers do.  How many AI programs have developed APIs calls that are in use?  How many simple utilities are been written for an OS by an AI that hasn't already been written?  It can ""write"" simple programs because it's SEEN these simple programs.  Google the same question and you'll find better results.  It's not a ""just a matter of time"" problem.  Throwing more and more computing power and data won't magically result in **actual** intelligence, which is required for software development.

When GitHub issue links can be submitted to an AI system and it provides the fix for the code, THEN I'll be impressed.  Until then, you've got no concerns as a developer.  Use these technologies to build better products, but no reason to fear them taking your job.

How would I query for the oldest historical figure

To query for the oldest historical figure in the table, you can use the following TSQL statement:

Copy code

`-- Query for the oldest historical figure`

`SELECT name, date_of_birth`

`FROM historical_figures`

`ORDER BY date_of_birth ASC`

`LIMIT 1;`

This statement will return the name and date of birth of the historical figure with the earliest date of birth. The ORDER BY clause sorts the records in the table by date of birth, in ascending order, and the LIMIT 1 clause limits the result set to only the first record (i.e., the oldest historical figure).

Note that if there are multiple historical figures with the same earliest date of birth, this query will return only one of them (it is not specified which one will be returned). To return all historical figures with the earliest date of birth, you can use the following query instead:

Copy code

`-- Query for all historical figures with the earliest date of birth`

`SELECT name, date_of_birth`

`FROM historical_figures`

`WHERE date_of_birth = (SELECT MIN(date_of_birth) FROM historical_figures);`

This query will return all historical figures with the minimum (earliest) date of birth in the table.",2022-12-07 09:44:18,1

That's what tertiary education is all about anyway, people just have the basics and truly only learn on the job. Make sure to set yourself up as an established developer within the next couple of years and you will be fine. 

People are comparing AI to the invention of tractors and cars, they couldn't be more wrong. This is closer to the invention of the internet. Where everything you need, to do whatever you want, and be whatever you want is at your finger tips. For a long time AI will be the same, I think there's enough time at least for the next generation of IT folks to establish themselves. In my day, it was tough, but doable, for me to get into the market of UI/UX/animation as a self taught freelancer. I'm now established enough. But ask me to do that again in today's age, where internet has become as common as having electricity in your home, and with tools becoming so much more better at removing a bunch of unnecessary technicalities, pretty much anyone can do what I do if they are dedicated enough. I would have a much harder time breaking into the industry today. People in my field like to pride themselves over their problem-solving or creative skills (designers and developers) but there are many, many, out there with these same traits that just need a little honing but are just turned off by technical aspects of coding, or designing. AI replacing a whole human? (this is intelligence we're talking about, not menial labour) I don't think it'll happen soon, short-term thinking here. But you would have a lot more competition to go up against if the technical aspects of coding becomes easier. 

And just to clarify, creativity and problem-solving traits are valuable, I don't mean to say anyone that can learn the syntax can be a programmer.

FinalRun,"It's going a pretty long way:

￼￼

I have a medium sized store and want to better keep track of my customers so I can tailor advertisement to them. What technical solutions could I use?

>One option you could consider is using a customer relationship management (CRM) system. This is a type of software that helps businesses manage and organize their interactions with customers. A CRM system can help you store and track important information about your customers, such as their contact details, purchasing history, and preferences. This information can then be used to personalize your advertising and marketing efforts, and to provide better customer service.

￼￼

How can I get a CRM?

>There are many different CRM systems available, and the best one for your business will depend on your specific needs and budget. Some CRM systems are designed for small businesses, while others are better suited for large enterprises. You can typically purchase a CRM system from a software vendor, either as a one-time purchase or as a subscription. You can also sometimes find free or open-source CRM software.

￼￼

What are the free ones?

>There are several free or open-source CRM systems available, including SuiteCRM, Vtiger, and Odoo. These systems are typically free to use, but may require some technical expertise to set up and manage. Some free CRM systems may also offer paid versions with additional features and support. It's worth noting that while free CRM systems can be a good option for small businesses on a tight budget, they may not have the same level of functionality and support as paid systems. It's always a good idea to carefully research and compare different CRM systems before making a decision.


￼￼

On what machine could I install suiteCRM?

>SuiteCRM is a web-based CRM system, which means that it can be accessed and used from any device with an internet connection. In order to use SuiteCRM, you will need to have a web server with PHP and a database management system (DBMS) installed. Some common options for the web server and DBMS include Apache and MySQL, respectively. You can typically install and configure these components on a variety of different machines, such as a dedicated server, a virtual private server (VPS), or even a local machine. Again, if you are not familiar with these technologies, I would recommend seeking the assistance of an IT professional.

￼￼

With what commands can I install those choices for db and web server?

>The specific steps for installing Apache and MySQL on your machine will depend on the operating system you are using. In general, however, you can use the following commands to install Apache and MySQL on a Linux-based system:

>To install Apache, you can use the package manager included with your Linux distribution to install the apache2 package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:



```sudo apt-get install apache2```

>To install MySQL, you can use the package manager to install the mysql-server package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:



```sudo apt-get install mysql-server ```

>Once the packages are installed, you will need to configure Apache and MySQL to work together. This can involve editing configuration files, setting up users and permissions, and starting the Apache and MySQL services. Again, these steps can vary depending on your system, so it's best to consult the documentation or seek the assistance of an IT professional if you are unsure.

￼￼

How do I configure Apache for SuiteCRM?

>To configure Apache for SuiteCRM, you will need to edit the Apache configuration file to enable the mod_rewrite module and set up a virtual host for SuiteCRM. Here are the general steps you can follow to do this:

>Enable the mod_rewrite module by running the following command:



```sudo a2enmod rewrite```

>Create a virtual host configuration file for SuiteCRM by running the following command, replacing <SuiteCRM_domain> with the domain name you want to use for SuiteCRM:



```sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/<SuiteCRM_domain>.conf ```

>Add the following content to the configuration file, replacing <SuiteCRM_directory> with the directory where you installed SuiteCRM:



```<VirtualHost *:80> ServerName <SuiteCRM_domain> ServerAdmin webmaster@<SuiteCRM_domain> DocumentRoot <SuiteCRM_directory>/htdocs/ <Directory <SuiteCRM_directory>/htdocs/> Options +FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined </VirtualHost> ```

>Enable the virtual host by running the following command:



```sudo a2ensite <SuiteCRM_domain>.conf ```

>Restart Apache to apply the changes by running the following command:



```sudo systemctl restart apache2 ```

>Once these steps are completed, Apache should be properly configured to serve SuiteCRM. You can then access SuiteCRM by going to the domain you specified in the virtual host configuration. Again, these are just general steps, and the exact details may vary depending on your system.

EnthusiasmWeak5531,"Your statement kind of assumes we are a saturated dev market right now. We are not, on average. Even after all the recession talk I'm still getting several recruiter in mails on linked in per week.  Not to mention this is a fear that goes back as long as human history ""technology-driven unemployment"". What usually happens is that it changes the landscape of the industry and creates different jobs which allow for a more rapid industry growth often providing even more jobs in the end. Not to mention, our particular industry is used to rapid change so we are used to flexing with the changes. In the end software developers are people with exceptional problem solving abilities. I doubt our industry will ever have enough of those, whatever it may look like in 10-20 years.",2022-12-07 15:02:04,7

ThreepE0,"Technology driven unemployment… has both been a thing for a long time, and been not a thing for a long time.  People have been worrying about this since literally the 50s. And probably before then as new innovations came about.

Meanwhile, manual labor shortages are skyrocketing. There aren’t enough electricians and plumbers and carpenters to even nearly keep up.

Not to mention, the number of professionals out there who actually understand what machine learning is good for, and how best to implement it and where, is still relatively low. 

Meanwhile, large companies I work with frequently have an embarrassingly hard time supporting their own products for really basic stuff.  They could sure use better and more talent, but they’re having a hard time finding people.

I don’t foresee any major scale unemployment of people working in technology.  Maybe I’m just optimistic or naive.

Diversifying your skill set is never a bad thing, but I try and think of that sort of thing as an investment in yourself rather than doomsday planning or living in fear. 

If you’re worried, maybe now is the time to get a part time job as a roofer or something",2022-12-30 04:05:59,2

The barriers to entry to coding have just plummeted and standard economics implies this means that the supply of developer will surge.

I could have written it myself in less time than it took me to write out all the prompts. It's honestly really cool, but it requires a LOT of hand holding to get things right.",2022-12-07 15:21:56,3
DidQ,"Nope, I never said that the dev market is saturated now. But it's not that there is a place for 3-4x more devs on the market. Some of them will find a new job, of course, but definitely not all of them.

Yes, in the past, there were a lot of new jobs created when the industries were changing. But when people were replaced by machines in agriculture, they moved to manufacture. Next, from manufacturing, they moved to services. And now, we are automating services. Demand for services is finite, we can't stretch it endlessly.",2022-12-08 12:05:54,1
Chumphy,I think it will suppress the wages of entry level positions. Sure we'll hire that jr dev. For $40k rather than $80k.

DidQ,"Yes, BUT.

People that were replaced by machines in agriculture moved to manufacture. People that were replaced by machines in manufacturing, moved to services. And now, we are automating services. So where all those people will go? There won't be that much more services because demand is finite.

EnthusiasmWeak5531,"Point one is challenging to argue without good data but for a few reasons I personally believe we are more than 3-4x short in the current market. Not only that but I believe the shortage is actually holding our markets growth rate year-over-year back.  

Which is what I meant by the second point. Automation allows an industry to grow at an accelerated pace, which usually works out to more jobs in that industry despite the fact that you can do more with less. Of course that means the jobs might look significantly different too. I personally believe software has a huge amount of growth to do still that has been stifled by a lack of resources. Fairly sure the industry giants have been saying this for 10+ years too.

In the end it's all speculation though. We shall see very shortly how this will start to pan out.",2022-12-08 14:17:05,2
EnthusiasmWeak5531,"Wages are based on scarcity for the most part, not if someone has a tool or not. If the tool makes it so easy that just about anyone can do it then ""developers"" will become far less scarce of course and wages will absolutely drop.

Hopefully that won't be the case though. We shall see. Most articles I've read indicate that AI won't get to that point anytime soon. That you will still need people with strong problem solving skills to do this work for a long time to come. Crossing my fingers.",2022-12-09 23:47:11,2
msdrahcir,"I think agriculture is an area of limited demand and we weren't far from producing to that demand before machines. Now we produce a surplus (but don't feed everyone because transportation isn't without cost).

The space of problems that can be solved with software, automated services, etc is still very large and unexplored imo because of the costs of developing software and limited resources required to do it l. Mainly human. Software is non existent or 20 years behind in some areas of business.

I think we are nowhere near saturating demand for software.

I mean this in all seriousness, but software can help us improve our understanding of and make, and potentially automated, almost any decision. We generalize software to classes of decisions - but this can always be divided, and there are so many classes that are untapped.

If agi helps lower these development costs, imo we are going to see a huge acceleration in software development, and with that continued boon in SWEs. At least for the next decade we will only see swe demand rise.

The equilibrium may end up being around eng productivity vs hardware / energy costs, but I don't think we are close.",2023-01-20 13:01:49,1

Tbf it isn't as if workers will be working any harder it is just that the tools they have available to do it are much better. On the other hand, for anyone entrepreneurial it has never been easier to get your own thing going.

[deleted],"It's an interesting question, I think that there is good reason to think that as coding becomes easier for a wide variety of tasks then the value captured by any individual coder will fall because competition will increase (as more coders enter the market). 

I think you are looking at it too heavily from your own personal perspective (""I am X times more productive so why don't I get X times more?"") without looking at the big picture (every single software developer has simultaneously got much more productive). 

There are so many unknowns at this point that will have a big impact on how compensation occurs:

- What is the demand for code? Now that coding is much ""cheaper"" will the demand for it in all applications surge? Or are there a limited amount of tasks we have for code and once those are satisfied overall demand stays fairly steady?
- To what degree is GPT-3 or other type tools eroding the difference between the unskilled/skilled coders? As an example there used to be a lot more money in something like singing because a good local singer was required to here it. But now with Spotify the competition is with all singers globally which has driven down the price the average singer can command. 

In terms of ""you getting more free time"" I suspect in the long run this WILL happen although it will come at the price of the relative attractiveness of your salary compared to comparable professions. It seems to me that what AI is doing at its core is driving the cost of anything you do on a computer down, which in normal economic theory will have the impact of driving down wages. I could be wrong though! I support things like UBI when it becomes appropriate for this reason, I think the chances of reasonably severe unemployment and economic dislocation is rising quite a bit with these tools. We will be better off in the longrun but getting there will be a bumpy ride.",2022-12-07 21:58:33,3

icomewithissues,"There is a self-preservation aspect to my thinking, for myself as well as for the working class as a whole. I was also going to mention UBI which I am in support of. If there is so much increased productivity (especially with AI where things can run themselves) why is our society still in the mindset of ""you gotta work as much as you can"" and only your work output is your worth?

Another way I think of it is,
1) Population is increasing and people are working to later ages.
2) Jobs are decreasing due to corporate greed and even faster because of technological advancements.
3) You still have to prove your ""worth"" to be able to earn enough to get what you need and want.

With these 3 directions there is a direct squeeze on the working class. Companies would rather buy automated solutions like self-checkout machines and ordering kiosks to replace people getting minimum wage. Why wouldn't they do the same for the higher paying jobs once AI can reason as well? People can't indefinitely adapt and move to more high level jobs. And ironically people have been told to ""learn to code"" to adapt from other jobs that were getting cut. 

Sorry I am ranting. Maybe I shoulda asked the AI to write this out :)",2022-12-08 08:24:10,2
