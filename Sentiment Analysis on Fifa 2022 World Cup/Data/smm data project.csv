"Im Dutch/Croatian so i didnt have the best week, but i hope Argentine go all the way. This Messi, Jesus Christ what a thing to watch. Best thing ive ever seen and probably will see, its just crazy.

And its also crazy to say its just a team build around him. Ofcourse he is the star but this team is so well balanced and every player is playing their part perfectly. The manager is smart and can change systems perfectly to suit different opponents.

So from the Netherlands with love: Vamos a agarrar este trofeo!!",12/13/22,reply,r/worldcup,130,2,post game

For me, the biggest disappointments so far are: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Uruguay, Denmark and Argentina. I don't think Belgium, Germany and Uruguay are going to pass to the next round.

And the surprises would be: Morocco, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada and Ecuador (even after disqualification). And I do think Ghana and Morrocco are going to the round of 16. Maybe the saudis will too, they look a surprisingly organized team.",11/30/22,Post,r/worldcup,2,40,Pre game

"The final was one of the best matches I've ever seen in my life. It truly was legendary
 Post Match Thread
Without exaggeration, that was one of the best games I can remember watching. It was amazing on many levels. The physicality and aggression of Argentina in the first half, the moment France woke up after the penalty in the second half, Mbappe's goal right after setting the stakes and the tension for the rest of the match. Even the fucking penalities were amazing to watch. As someone who plays keeper himself, Martinez will forever be a legend and a hero to me.

Congratulations to all Argentinians. Congratulations to all of the French as well. Y'all put forth so much fucking heart and helped create one of the best matches of all time. This match truly is legendary. Both team's performances were legendary and supporters of both teams should feel proud of their teams",12/19/22,Post,r/worldcup,84,28,post game

"If France won this game, I would probably stop watching football until Mbappe retires

He's like a hacker in a video game, completely breaks the game meta and takes the fun out of it, I admit, he's just TOO good, too OP, to the point that it can be completely pointless to be interested in any match that he's playing (at least that's what happened in this WC, one time he wasn't in the starting eleven was with Tunisia which was indeed interesting to follow)
