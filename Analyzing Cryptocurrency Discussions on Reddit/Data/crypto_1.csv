TheElusiveFox,"So here's my advice as some one who has been in this space for almost 10 years now... you can participate in forums like these... but don't make trading decisions based on them.

A lot of sentiment here is bullshit, there is very little ""real"" knowledge both about the markets in general, and the underlying tech of crypto.  These places will be hype right up until the day after the market crashes and will be doom and gloom until the day after its going back up and that is just how things are...

There isn't really enough moderation to steer the community towards more technical or actual newsworthy posts, so instead the community is basically a giant ball of hype and is incredibly easy to manipulate, and if you let yourself and your trading decisions be directed by them its a recipe for a very big loss.

Instead I suggest setting multiple targets and not changing them so you don't fall victim to hype, and pulling your money out in steps the same way you put it in... that lets you take 20% out in a bull run like this, then if it falls back down, you made at least some profit, and if it keeps going you can hit another target...",2023-12-06 14:13:08,31

It's always a bull trap the question is time horizon. This is not the pump we've been waiting for IMO.

Justin534,"I don't think so I've been bullish for a long time now. Feds most likely done hiking rates and everyone's looking ahead to interest rates falling now. Maybe there will be one more small rate hike but that doesn't change expectations that we're at the top of the rate hiking cycle. Rates go up and the most speculative assets, like crypto, get hit the hardest. On the other side of the interest rate cycle as money becomes easier to come by then speculative assets get the biggest boost. Not saying it's going to be up, up and away from here. But I think we've seen the bottom of this bear market. Just my 2 cents anyways. 

There's plenty of news that will tell you this is a good time to rotate into speculative assets classes. But mainly it's news regarding interest rates and inflation numbers. Or on chain data - which is the news we should be looking at. We gotta know where to look though. 

Don't focus too much on what's going on with this or that exchange, or some crypto companies. If you're interested in their stock price than sure pay attention. But if you're interested in the price of crypto assets generally I think that's all more noise than signal. The signal is in on chain metrics. Take a look at artemis.xyz and coin metrics. Look at number of on chain transactions, what people are willing to pay in fees, and numbers of active user accounts. If usage numbers go up (which they are) so will price especially when we're on the second half of the monetary cycle.",2023-12-06 21:16:21,0

If the bottom was in fact Nov '22 and bull market started then, I'd argue that the bear market was only 1 year long (Nov '21 to Nov '22) and previous bull market was also 12-18 months long depending on how you want to look at the charts. So according to that logic, wouldn't that indicate that we're nearing the end of the current bull market?

Obviously this also doesn't take into account the broader market and macro forward outlook which isn't looking great IMO.

A bull trap is a bounce that happens after a big crash / decline.  Afterwards it continues sliding and the bulls lose money.

A bear trap is a rise in price after a period of inactivity followed by a sudden decline; Afterwards it continues rising into a bull market and the bears who sold miss out.

Considering our decline was over a year ago and we had months of inactivity in between, and things have been rising steadily for months now, this is clearly...... A bull trap!  Right? :P",2023-12-06 19:58:26,12

It's just that some want to risk it all. Hoping 10 years from now Bitcoin is still relevant and increasing in value. Others want to make sure they secure some profit if it all goes to hell.

Latespoon,"It's very simple and not the answer anyone here wants to hear.
It is market makers hedging against large volumes of CME BTC options. These are typically purchased by institutions as a means of exposure to BTC without issues like custodial risk.
When these contracts are redeemed/sold/expire, the MM no longer need to hold the underlying asset (BTC) as a hedge.
Which means they sell. They sell into retail FOMO buys.
And make no mistake, institutions are going to take profit on these because they know what's coming next on a macroeconomic scale.

Sure, a tiny bit less BTC is being created each day, but that's meaningless compared to daily trading volume.  The decrease is like .01% of daily volume.  That doesn't matter at all.

What DOES matter?  The last 4 cycles were in a rate lowering environment.  Now the Fed has been tightening.

The only reason the halving may cause any spike is because a bunch of people are convinced it will and it's a self fulfilling prophecy.  Those folks could just as easily be wrecked.
