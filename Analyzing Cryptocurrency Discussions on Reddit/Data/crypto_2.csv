Sometimes I feel sorry for them. They are so caught up in their expensive consumer lifestyle without any monthly savings that they will have to work until they are old, and the chances are high they won't even get a good enough pension in 20-30 years because government will continue to fuck up the currency.

DontDieSenpai,"Inflation on it's own is rats' nest; people argue over what it means all the time. Some use it to refer to what I would call actual inflation or monetary debasement and some use CPI. These two groups do not seem to be able to come to an agreement at all, even though they're both technically correct.

Just mentioning inflation as monetary debasement in some subs is a cardinal sin next to murder.

IMO, it's just basic misunderstanding and a lot of that is super basic semantics.

The widest divide is between the Keynesians and the Austrians. Keynesians scoff when you point out how their economic philosophy has effectively eliminated the ability to save. They'll respond that one should invest, and often describe actual saving as ""hoarding"". And they don't see this POV as problematic in any way. They honestly believe monetary debasement is necessary for a healthy economy and many seem to believe nigh infinite money printing isn't going to cause any longterm problems.

Zealousideal_Set_333,"It's bitterness about someone else having got ahead from their BTC investment, while they didn't already have the same success. 

[ECB report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2024/html/ecb.blog20240222\~0929f86e23.en.html) today is fueled by the same bitterness about perceived loss of power.

The ECB perspective isn't entirely incorrect: The ECB correctly identifies that Bitcoin redistributes wealth. However, the ECB's jargon about being at the expense of the less sophisticated just isn't what they think. In fact, by virtue of successfully hodling BTC without falling victim to a scam, you have been sophisticated. 

ECB is bitter that the US has enabled BTC to be an acceptable mainstream investment for financial institutions by approving the BTC ETFs. 

However, unlike for governments, the average individual who isn't already a billionaire would still benefit from supporting BTC wealth redistribution. The people OP mentions aren't recognizing this.

To be honest, I don't believe that in 100 years the entire world will run on a cash-like digital gold currency like BTC. BTC has many flaws that will likely prevent it from ever being the universal world currency -- and I think the people OP mentions have likely correctly identify the flaws in the maxi narrative.  
  
Nevertheless, BTC is popular as a hedge against inflation and a way to protect your money from government intervention. It is what it is. These people are struggling to set their emotions and resentment aside that despite BTC's flaws compared to a perfect digital currency, BTC now has a huge moat as the world's digital gold. 

The ECB is, in fact, the one with no clothes at the moment. The average person would do well to recognize that.",2024-02-22 18:24:09,15

I'm *very* new here. I've been trying to keep my head down, learn as much as possible and I've been hesitant to comment because I don't want to bring any attention to the fact that that I hold *any* btc. But the second I started to understand the potential of what bitcoin is, I immediately started putting all my side money into this. It took a lot of critical, independent thinking to realize any point is a good point to start. I didn't feel the need to ask if small buys were a good idea, I recognized bitcoin potential applies to everyone at different levels, what you can afford has the potential to benefit *your* life greatly.

I stand by the sentiment ""everyone deserves bitcoin at the price they buy at."" At one point in time I may have taken that as a slight, and maybe it's intended to be. But it's also a very mature way of looking initially getting started. The writings been on the wall for a long time. Both in regards to btc's continued success and all of bearing witness and *feeling* the dollar inflating. Dca-ing, trading in shit coins (if you can, and they aren't locked behind judicial action), whatever strategy you feel called to: immediately becomes a priority if you 'get it' on any level.

We're witnessing truly remarkable shit. I've learned across the board in many different aspects of life, it can take folks a really long time to validate anything that inherently pokes holes at structures they depend on. Even ""in your face without a doubt remarkable shit,"" but contradicts the status quo or the powers that be. Bitcoin does that in a huge way and I think unfortunately many folks will continue to hit the hurdles of thinking it's a scam, until realizing it's not but feeling intimidated by the (face melting?) price points btc will be at when they come around. Then again maybe over time folks will understand it better by the time they're jumping in.

So if I‚Äôm understanding correctly, you‚Äôd say most people‚Äôs frustration is directed towards the distribution of wealth rather than towards the declining power of individual dollars. And the underlying thought would be that a fairer distribution of money (through things like wage increases that keep up with inflation or through the establishment of rules that prevent billionaires from existing in the first place) would be the best way to combat the problem.

So, in the eyes of the detractors, bitcoin is a wealth-preservation tool that is inaccessible to people who haven‚Äôt already amassed their fortune. And the fact that there‚Äôs no central agency able to issue/redistribute it is a negative, because ideally the solution would be found through a sort of managed balancing of the pie - even if the pie itself gets bigger and bigger.

To be quite honest, I have fallen completely in love with bitcoin because of what it stands for. I often shake, and at times, my voice trembles with excitement when I talk about it with others in person. It's only ever really with people I am close to, though there have been some exceptions. 

I can not help but feel a deep, burning passion for it.

I have been working with my current employer (Higher Ed) to help encourage adoption of bitcoin, and it's actually paid off in small ways. Our technology program has a small number of miners now, and they decided to mine bitcoin with them! The professor who led the charge in getting the miners setup actually considered ETH, but we had a chat about it before the miners arrived, and he left a bit more skeptical of ETH than when he arrived. It doesn't happen often (work obviously comes first), but I've had some great talks with the professors in that department, and they're actually located in the same building (which is just AWESOME). While I can't be sure how much of an impact I've had, I hope I've helped contribute in some small way.

I'm trying to do anything I can to help spread the beautiful ideas behind bitcoin. I know not everyone has the same amount of influence or opportunity to do so, but I hope to help encourage others to look for opportunities and take them when they get the chance. Our attempts may or may not succeed, but I don't think that's the point. I truly believe that those of us who have come to realize the power of bitcoin are obligated to share these ideas with others. We absolutely shouldn't spam people, badger, or belittle them; but we should keep our eyes open, listen for the knock of opportunity, and seize the moment if/when it arrives.

No worries. Your passion is perceivable, so kudos to you for that. We do indeed have a duty, we being the ones who understand and have the means (some smart men once said ""those who are capable are also responsible"").

That said, especially because you love Bitcoin so much and feel a sense of duty, I would encourage you to also think deeply about its potential problems, in part because you owe it honesty but also because only by being aware and rational can we push Bitcoin to success and avoid sleepwalking into pitfalls -- else we're just another group of fanatics with (potentially big) blindspots which eventually become assailable.

I'm not going to list many of them here, but I encourage thinking beyond the usual (rather shallow and known) issues like energy, mining profitability, tokenomics soundness in the issuance tail, etc. For example, two topics I personally found interesting and have been involved in discussing are (1) the wealth divide danger due to different market entry dates in a pure deflationary bitcoin based economy, which translates to inheritance dynamics that risk creating a potentially bigger wealth divide than fiat and Keynesian economics did; and (2) incentivisation of entrepreneurship in the same kind of economy, contrasting the modern job & entrepreneurship mentality in an economy model that killed savings, to a potential lackluster of incentive for entrepreneurship in an economy model where savings intrinsically appreciate enough to not even need much work or entrepreneurship. And many other more or less profound topics to consider that we might be sleepwalking into without proper consideration. Playing the devil's advocate for the things you love is one of the best ways to really grasp its properties, good and bad, and become capable to do something about both. Experience is the next best way (requires ample time), and also builds authority.

There was a post once on /r/Bitcoin from a person who asked a simple question on the topic of (1) above, which prompted replies of a higher caliber than what you typically see in this cesspool of a sub (sorry).

>Bitcoin is not useful as money because its barrier to use it as such is too prohibitive

This is where I disagree with your position in particular. I think you don't fully grasp the distinction between ""good currency"" vs ""good money"".

The ""barrier"" to using Bitcoin as a currency is indeed prohibitive at the moment, because most merchants don't accept it for payments, and because the lightning network is not yet widely adopted either. There are many other currencies that are currently more efficient at being a currency than Bitcoin, including fiat.

On the other hand, there is almost no ""barrier"" to using Bitcoin as money. The barrier is certainly lower than USD - you don't need a bank to hold Bitcoin (you can hold it directly), and there is no minimum amount nor possibility of censorship. To understand this point, you first need to rethink your concept of money as a medium used to store value over time. Bitcoin is ideal money - the usefulness *is* the decentralized store of value which is immune to debasement, traits which no other money in existence can accurately claim to have.

Now, you may say that my definition of Bitcoin's use as money is merely ""speculation"" or ""investing"", however the fundamental monetary properties and game theory that's baked into the Bitcoin protocol make it less of a ""speculation"" and more of a ""discovery"".

A government must have a secure currency which cannot be manipulated (to as far an extent as possible) to prevent foreign interference. Bitcoin has an exceptionally high barrier to be used pratrically, and i have a difficult time seeing that change due to what i said here.

As far as technical barriers. the lightning protocol does seem to address that. But even the lightning protocol does seem to have limits by bitcoin. For example . . . How many active wallets do you envision with mass adoption of bitcoin? and how often should those be resolved/updated using the lightning protocol? because bitcoin can only do 600k transactions per day. Meaning you can only update \~600k wallets once per day. Even with lightning protocol that is an extremely bleak propsect and IMO a fatal flaw.

with a decentralized blockchain like bitcoin you also lose a ton of flexability. Imagine 2008 without the fed able to pump money into banks. Bank runs anyone? Fiat currency and inflation are EXCEPTIONALLY powerful tools. I think they are easy to demonize as they have very obvious ways they are abused.
